Presentation given at the APTA Combined Sections meeting in 2015 on dynamic inference in cardiopulmonary PT practice. The presentation defined dynamic inference as a generalized form of reasoning in evidence based practice and pointed out challenges in research to practice associated with the complexity of the clinical cases in cardiopulmonary PT. Dynamic inference refers to the flow of thought where we use premises (statements with a probability of truth) to draw inferences and conclusions. Conclusions are utilized as premises in continued inferential processes and determine, but do not restrict, practice. At a fundamental level there are at least three types of inference utilized in clinical practice: deductive, inductive and abductive. Inductive infers general conclusions (premises) from specific data; this is what emerges from research studies and systematic reviews. Hill's criteria of causation and the hierarchy of evidence help us weigh the strength of such general premises. Deductive inference infers specific conclusions from general premises (typically from inductive inference). Both inductive and deductive inferences have well-established rules of justification and typically infer from cause to effect. Abductive inference is an attempt to infer effect from cause and does not have a well-established rule for justification (inverse problem). Clinical practice requires a dynamic flow of these forms of inference in information - interpretation - action. The influence of evidence in the process is dependent on the justification of the premises and thus there are critical bottlenecks in any given clinical scenario to the application of evidence-based practice. This presentation will explain these bottlenecks using causal graph models with emphasis on the combinatorial explosion of cardiopulmonary cases as inherently complex. There are two possible uses presented. First the presentation will encourage thinking about reasoning in complex cases to leverage the use of heuristics. Heuristics reduce information demand in complex cases. A low probability of error necessitates the proper application of heuristics. Thus, implications for evidence interpretation to application should be considered in going from evidence to practice guidelines. Second the presentation demonstrates how the web of causal interactions and number of abductive inferences can be used to quantify complexity of a clinical case and with increasing complexity of a case there is an exponential rise in the probability of error. Each of the uses of applying an analysis of the dynamic inference of clinical reasoning are independently important to members. First related to clinical practice recommendations and second related to consideration of the complexity of clinical cases. In addition, this approach demonstrates that cardiopulmonary cases are intrinsically complex and this influences the types of evidence required and the process of taking evidence to practice recommendations. So there is an interactive effect between the evidence interpretation to application and the clinical complexity components of dynamic inference in general, and cardiopulmonary PT in particular.
