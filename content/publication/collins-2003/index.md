abstract: "In 1955, after two decades of research on the General Adaptation Syndrome, Selye proposed a description of Adaptive Energy as the adaptability that is gradually con- sumed during exposure. Selye was never able to provide a more complete description of such energy. This presenta- tion proposes a theory of Adaptive Energy in an attempt to provide measurement opportunities for further research. Measurement would allow quantification of the impact of multiple modes of stress on human function. Stress is broadly conceptualized to represent any perturbing force to physiological processes. For patients receiving physical therapy, stressors include not only the pathologies, impair- ments, functional limitations and disabilities, but also the environmental exposures as part of their lives, and physical therapy interventions. The Adaptive Energy theory pro- pounds that the number of possible states within the human system needs to be greater than the number of possible dis- turbances in order to minimize the deviation of that system from its state of stability. Adaptive Energy is the number of states available to the human system across spatial and tem- poral scales. Adaptive Energy is manifest as the presence of variation within fundamental components of the physiolog- ical control system. Supporting research will be presented from diverse scientific areas which have utilized heart rate variability, approximate entropy, correlation dimensions, and more recently the author's own work in the area of car- diac vagal regulation utilizing Poincare plot analyses, where healthy subjects reporting exhaustion had the lowest levels of short term variation in vagal cardiac control. An abundance of evidence demonstrates associations between reduced system level variations with adaptive energy based outcomes such as exhaustion, overtraining syndrome, con- gestive heart failure and myocardial infarction. Mechanisms of testing the theory (including those under- way) in both animal and human models will be discussed. Implications for clinical practice include: 1 . current possi- bilities for heart rate variability outcomes in heart disease patients; 2. the use of an aggregate system variability mea- sure to provide a clinical assessment of available adaptive energy either for short term (within a treatment) or long term (through the course of treatment) adaptation."
