abstract: "Both mental workload and stress associated with environmental and psychological factors affect cognitive functioning as reflected in functional state and work performance. In the work environment of the post-totalitarian society, the individuals are exposed to the complex interactions of the effect of mental workload, environmental, social and economic stress factors. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of workload and stress on operator functional state, and to predict future performance decrement. Intrinsic and actual heart rate as well as spectral components of HRV change as a function of this complex interaction. Most sensitive to workload and stress are the intrinsic and actual heart rate, and the spectral power of RR intervals in the Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia band (0.15-0.5 Hz)(PRSA) and in the Traube-Hering-Mayer band (0.05-0.14 Hz)(PTHM) in Mill factory operators and military pilots. Mechanisms that may induce suboptimal response pattern are chronic sympathetic stimulation which increases slow diastolic depolarization, decreased parasympathetic activity mediating PRSA and PTHM. and decreased baroreceptor modulation of heart rate, assessed by PTHMâ€¢ By examining RSA we infer that the occupational groups most likely affected by eventual performance decrement are Mill factory operators, military pilots and drivers."
