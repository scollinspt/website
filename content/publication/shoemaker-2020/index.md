abstract: "The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), in conjunction with the Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Section of APTA, have commissioned the development of this clinical practice guideline to assist physical therapists in their clinical decision making when managing patients with heart failure. Physical therapists treat patients with varying degrees of impairments and limitations in activity and participation associated with heart failure pathology across the continuum of care. This document will guide physical therapist practice in the examination and treatment of patients with a known diagnosis of heart failure. The development of this clinical practice guideline followed a structured process and resulted in 9 key action statements to guide physical therapist practice. The level and quality of available evidence were graded based on specific criteria to determine the strength of each action statement. Clinical algorithms were developed to guide the physical therapist in appropriate clinical decision making. Physical therapists are encouraged to work collaboratively with other members of the health care team in implementing these action statements to improve the activity, participation, and quality of life in individuals with heart failure and reduce the incidence of heart failure-related re-admissions"
