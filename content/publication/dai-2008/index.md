abstract: "OBJECTIVE To compare the predictive validity of the demand control and effort-reward imbalance model, alone and in combination with each other, for job burnout in Shanghai employees. METHODS A sample of 1368 Shanghai employees responded to a core job stress questionnaire and burnout scale in Chinese. Hierarchically moderated multiple regressions were used to analyze the relationship between job stress and burnout. RESULTS All factors from both job stress models predicted 33.5\% of the variance in emotional exhaustion, and 20.9\% in depersonalization and 5.5\% in personal accomplishment. Factors from the effort-reward model demonstrated more power in predicting emotional exhaustion and depersonalization than that of demand control model. Personal accomplishment was significantly associated with sociodemographic factors. OUTCOME The combination of two models may improve our understanding of the relationship between the psychosocial work environment and job burnout."
