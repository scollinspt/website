abstract: "Chronic heart failure (HF) is a common diagnosis seen by physical therapists in many settings. This Year in Review article specifically focuses on current empirical evidence regarding escalating readmissions for HF and the potential role physical therapists can play in reducing these events. We examine the current HF readmission prediction models using the International Classifications of Function, Disability, and Health framework to highlight the need to consider reduced exercise capacity, ability to perform activities of daily living, and quality of life as integrated, inherent, and integral components of chronic HF itself. Consideration of stability at the levels of body structure and function, activity, and participation is proposed, and related literature is reviewed and integrated."
