abstract: "Objective. To identify elements of the environment that patients consider when evaluating the quality of a care experience in outpatient rehabilitation settings. Design. A qualitative study using a modified grounded theory approach. Data collection used semistructured interviewing during 9 focus groups. Setting. Three postacute ambulatory centers in metropolitan areas. Participants. Adults (N=57; 33 men, 24 women) undergoing outpatient rehabilitation for musculoskeletal conditions/injuries. Interventions. Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures. Not applicable. Results. Participants perceived the quality of rehabilitation service on the basis of their experiences with environmental factors, including 3 physical factors (facility design, ambient conditions, and social factors) and 4 organizational factors (duration of attendance, interruptions during delivery of care, waiting times in the sequence of treatment, and patient safety). Conclusions. This study identifies the specific environmental attributes that patients consider important when evaluating the quality of outpatient rehabilitation settings and develops a patient-based framework for assessing the overall perception of service quality. Further research should work to develop self-report questionnaires about patient experiences with the environment in rehabilitation services to provide empirical and quantitative evidence. "
