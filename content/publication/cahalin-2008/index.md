abstract: "Very little information exists regarding physical therapy educational and professional issues in various regions of the world. A better understanding may facilitate physical therapy (PT) practice, education, and research around the globe. The purpose of this study was to gain a worldwide perspective of physical therapy educational and professional issues in 40 separate countries. Forty countries known to provide PT were chosen from a World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT) list of affiliates based on language, geography, and presumed PT practice. An English survey consisting of 22 items and four primary areas (accreditation of PT educational programs, licensure, specialization, and earning potential) was translated into five different languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, Japanese, and Korean). The survey was administered electronically to key WCPT contacts in the 40 countries. The response rate was 42.5 percent and revealed modest diversity in physical therapy educational and professional issues among countries with the exception that 1. all but one country had an accreditation process for PT educational programs, 2. all but one country had licensure for PTs, and 3. all but five countries had a specialization process that included a written examination. Modest diversity in physical therapy educational and professional issues appears to exist among countries except for accreditation, licensure, and specialization. "
