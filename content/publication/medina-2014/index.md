abstract: "Objective To identify elements of the physiotherapist–patient interaction considered by patients when they evaluate the quality of care in outpatient rehabilitation settings. Design A qualitative study with nine focus groups, Two researchers conducted the focus groups, and a topic guide with predetermined questions was used. Each group discussion was audiotaped,, transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically according to a modified grounded theory approach. Setting Three postacute ambulatory centers in Barcelona, Madrid and Seville (Spain). Participants Fifty-seven adults undergoing outpatient rehabilitation for musculoskeletal conditions/injuries. Results Patients based their evaluations of quality of care on their assessment of physiotherapists’ willingness to provide information and education, technical expertise and interpersonal manners (eg. respect, emotional support and sensitivity changes in the patient's status). Both positive and negative aspects of the physiotherapist–patient interaction emerged under all these themes, except for friendly and respectful communication. Conclusion This study identified which elements of the physiotherapist–patient interaction are considered by patients when evaluating the quality of care in rehabilitation outpatient settings. Further research should work to develop self-report questionnaires about patients’ experiences of the physiotherapist–patient interaction in rehabilitation services to provide empirical and quantitative evidence."
