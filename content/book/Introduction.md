## Clinical Inquiry
### Conceptual Foundations for Practice

#### About this notebook

Clinical Inquiry, Conceptual Foundations for Practice is a notebook to share several tools for the integration of theory and practice. The work for this this project spans the author's career. While there is much to write, what is written was completed in Fall 2013 while on sabbatical; Spring 2015 while writing a blog; and during the Spring and Summer of 2020 while under quarantine for COVID-19. The process of writing and of conversion from various sources to this web-presentation is ongoing and will most likely mirror my preparation for and teaching in various courses. 

[Part 1](/book/Part_1) is generally material that is expected in my Clinical Inquiry I course (which then follows through Clinical Inquiry II and III with further applications). These courses essentially flow from the logic of uncertainty, reasoning (Clinical Inquiry I) to the application of various models. Models are considered from individual observations and studies in Clinical Inquiry II, and built from syntopical analysis of several studies in Clinical Inquiry III. This part of the book are based primarily on, and at this point almost almost exclusively related to, work done as part of the author's [Clinical Inquiry project](/project/clinical-inquiry/). The work for this part has been enabled and facilitated by the author's pursuit of understanding related to a life long devotional project on [Christian Theology, Apologetics and Spiritual Discipline](/project/christian-theology/).

[Part 2](/book/Part_2) and [Part 3](/book/Part_3) are concepts that are important to the practice of physical therapy. They are present in various ways in several courses throughout any DPT program as well as in practice. However, they are often discussed with different language and a general lack of conceptually explicit coherence. This is what the book aims to provide.  It is what the author aims to provide when teaching his course on Clinical Physiology (introduction to adaptation) and Patient-Client Management 5 (cardiovascular and pulmonary physical therapy). [Part 2](/book/Part_2) loosely corresponds to the author's courses in clinical anatomy and physiology as the important concepts that students must take from those courses in addition to knowledge about anatomy and physiology. [Part 3](/book/Part_3) loosely corresponds to the "systems" course sequence in the Plymouth State University DPT program that the author developed, though not in the same sequence.
