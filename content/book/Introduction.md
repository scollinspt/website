## Clinical inquiry notebook
### Philosophical Foundations for Practice

#### About this notebook

Clinical Inquiry, Philosophical Foundations for Practice is a notebook to share several tools for the integration of theory and practice. The tools are broken into three parts that correspond to the "how", "what", and "why" of practice. The work for this this project spans the author's career. While there is much to write, what is written was completed in Fall 2013 while on sabbatical; Spring 2015 while writing a blog; and during the Spring and Summer of 2020 while under quarantine for COVID-19. The process of writing and of conversion from various sources to this web-presentation is ongoing and will most likely mirror my preparation for and teaching in various courses. 

[Part 1](/book/Part_1) is the approach to inquiry and focuses on logic and epistemology ("how"). This is the topic of my Clinical Inquiry I course (which then follows through Clinical Inquiry II and III with further applications). These courses flow from the logic of uncertainty to decision making under uncertainty (Clinical Inquiry I) through the use of logical, causal models that are representations of reality. Models are considered from individual observations and studies in Clinical Inquiry II, and built from syntopical analysis of several studies in Clinical Inquiry III. This part of the notebook is based primarily on, and at this point almost almost exclusively related to, work done as part of the author's [Clinical Inquiry project](/project/clinical-inquiry/). The work for this part has been enabled and facilitated by the author's career as a professor of physical therapy and philosophical pursuits related to a life long devotional project on [Christian Theology, Apologetics and Spiritual Discipline](/project/christian-theology/).

[Part 2](/book/Part_2) is the object, that is the object of study that is important for physical therapy practice (meta-physics, "what"). The proposal of Part 2 is that a meta-physics of physical therapy practice is based on seeing the world as a hierarchical set interacting complex adaptive systems (CAS). CAS are present in various ways in several courses throughout any DPT program as well as in practice. However, they are often discussed with different language and a general lack of conceptually explicit coherence. This is what the notebook aims to provide.  It is what the author aims to provide when teaching his course on Clinical Physiology and Patient-Client Management 5 (cardiovascular and pulmonary physical therapy). [Part 2](/book/Part_2) corresponds to the author's dissertation on how job strain is caused by the social organization of work which then influences worker cardiovascular regulation (hierachical sets of interacting CAS). CAS are ubiquitous in practice and as the author pointed out in 2003 pose a major challenge when attempting to translate research to practice. 

[Part 3](/book/Part_3) are the reasons we practice, the "why" and is on ethics and values.
