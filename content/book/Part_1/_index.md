# Introduction to Logic and Epistemology

## Causal Models

The ultimate goal of Part 1 is that the reader understand how to develop and reason with causal models as logico-mathematical representations of reality (including its uncertainty) with which we practice (reason and make decisions), and from which we develop further understanding through research. The state of knowledge in the profession at any point in time can be considered as equivalent to the set of all the possible causal models we can build and from which we practice; and when working with a patient we can consider the patient (at a moment in time) as an instantiation (a particular state) of one to several inter-connected causal models and that there is a complex underlying dynamic of change that is, at least partially, predicted from state to state by the causal model. Part 2 includes further consideration of these causal models as complex adaptive systems (CAS), the object or metaphysical basisi for practice.

## Purpose

Clinical inquiry requires the use of clinical logic, epistemology and reasoning (CLEaR). The purpose of such an undertaking started to answer the question: What can be done to improve the utilization of research by physical therapists in practice? [1,2] It has now expanded to include explicit consideration of what can be done to improve clinical reasoning through the utilization of knowledge in practice. We accept the definition of knowledge as justified true belief.  Goals include increasing the effectiveness of inquiry to: generate knowledge through the rigorous rational (mental, mindful, reflective) interpretation of observations (structured as research, and experienced in practice); and utilize knowledge in both practice and continued research. It is proposed that even by making progress toward these goals we can better educate students in preparation for entry level and subsequently expert practice, reduce cognitive biases and errors in reasoning, and reduce variability in practice decisions in a way that clinical practice guidelines have not been able to achieve.


Clinical Inquiry as a system includes clinical reasoning so it is helpful to define clinical reasoning. A complete understanding of this definition requires an understanding of inference (Chapter 3) so the reader is asked to keep this in mind while progressing through Chapters 1 and 2. Clinical reasoning includes making inferences iteratively across time (dynamic inference); and making decisions based on those inferences. Therefore, clinical reasoning is dynamic inference and decision making.  Clinical reasoning as a stream of dynamic inferences that enable clinical decision making are then combined with carrying out the decisions and in sum is called clinical practice. Therefore, clinical practice is combining decisions with carrying out those decisions.

## Logical & Epistemological Axioms

Logic and epistemology offer tools that have a long history and have been demonstrated to be reasonably effective to address the questions and goals of our clinical inquiry. These areas of philosophy provide axioms (first principles) for rules to guide thought and address what and how something can be considered knowledge (known). The axioms included in our system come from Bhaskar’s critical realism [1] and Gries & Schneider’s equational logic [2]. From these axioms we develop an understanding of validity, inference, theorems, probability and causation. A clinical inquiry must be coherent, integrated and consistent. The communication of this clinical inquiry must also balance too much detail regarding how these theoretical foundations emerge to their practical implications and the need to be practical. Future revisions will expand upon connections currently accepted in an attempt to fulfill the requirement of being coherent, integrated and consistent.

## Necessity of Logic & Epistemology

Logic and epistemology are both necessary for clinical reasoning and therefore for clinical practice. Logic includes the rules of thinking that allows deduction and forms of valid inferences. This is a necessary component of deductive reasoning utilized to identify the most appropriate plan of care in a particular situation on the basis of a set of assumed premises (interventional reasoning). Epistemology includes probability as an approach to belief and knowledge. This is a necessary component of the inductive reasoning utilized to generate universally accepted truths (universals developed through observations) that can be utilized in deductive arguments. Both epistemology and logic are required for appropriate consideration of abductive reasoning utilized to identify the most likely set of situations (causes, risks, modifiers) that resulted in a current situation (diagnostic reasoning). Abductive reasoning looks suspiciously like deduction without the ability to be valid and therefore requires epistemology and probability to achieve a level of justification to be considered believable. 

Despite the necessity of this dynamic interplay of inferential approaches in clinical reasoning it is rare to consider probability and statistics within the broader framework of epistemology; and it is rare to consider epistemology along with logic in the literature on clinical reasoning. Yet they are all necessary for any consideration of our reasoning and decision making. Any system of reasoning and decision making begins with and builds from a logical and epistemological foundation. If you have not considered the logical and epistemological foundation for your clinical reasoning then you are more likely to succumb to fallacies, errors and biases in your clinical reasoning.

### Causation

Knowing about and understanding causation is necessary to understand adaptation and PT practice. It is also more fundamental and closer to the philosophical home of our axioms and foundations. Any attempt to understand, predict future states or manipulate a system and/or its adaptation requires an understand causation. Cause - effect relationships are the foundational concept of all clinical and scientific inquiry (including practice). The only reason to believe a treatment will work is that the belief that there is a cascade of mechanisms (cause - effect responses) triggered by the treatment and the sum of the effect is adaptation. The only reason to believe in the process of diagnosis based on signs and symptoms is to believe certain conditions cause a certain rather unique pattern of signs and symptoms.

Understanding causation can seem rather simple. What is complicated is understanding causation in a real world complex system where there are many components and a vast hierarchy of emerging and interacting parts. There is a stark contrast between closed and open systems, particularly when it comes to the study of causation within these systems. This contrast underlies the classic problem of generalization - how to take an understanding about causal relationships from a closed system (experimental conditions) to the patient in an open system (real life). Therefore while the inclusion of causation as a concept is entailed by the axioms (forthcoming). The actual identification of cause - effect relationships in the real world and under what conditions and in what contexts they apply is an important application of the clinical inquiry process. There is a focus on attempting to understand the ways of knowing causal relationships in light of underlying complex interaction. This is why clinical inquiry includes the consideration of graphical causal model representations of causal networks (as logical structures) that then allow the development of reasoning patterns based on the network structure. This is an overarching approach for both how knowledge is developed from evidence (evidence based practice), and how we should practice based on the knowledge (knowledge based practice).

## Exercises

- (I.1)	Using the definition provided for clinical reasoning and clinical practice explain how they are connected and provide an example. 
- (I.2)	What does it mean to consider a physical therapy clinical reasoning from first principles? What does it mean to consider a physical therapy intervention from first principles?
- (I.3)	Try to explain some of your foundational beliefs about how the world works in one (or two) paragraph(s) and provide an example of what it or they (singularly or collectively) mean for how you will practice physical therapy. For example, if you have a foundational belief that people are to be distrusted, how does that impact your practice of physical therapy?
- (I.4)	Provide and briefly explain the components of one example of a “system” in physical therapy practice that you are learning about this semester.
- (I.5)	Provide and briefly explain an example of physical therapy practice that includes the concept of adaptation.
- (I.6) 	Provide and briefly explain an example of physical therapy practice that depends on a belief of causation.
