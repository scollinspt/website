Axioms are first principles. They are are basic propositions or assumptions that cannot be deduced from other propositions or assumptions.  The first foundation of our Clinical Inquiry are epistemological axioms (as opposed to logical axioms which are covered later). We could have started with logical axioms. The decision to start with epistemological axioms is because a Clinical Inquiry is a system of clinical epistemology - concerned with clinical knowledge, especially regarding its methods, validity, and scope. A second reason is that in Clinical Inquiry we use logic to justify the truth of our beliefs. Which means, we use logic to validate knowledge. Therefore, in Clinical Inquiry logic is used in the service of epistemology, not the other way around (epistemology in the service of logic). Though in the system epistemology does set some useful parameters for the use of logic which is why logic and epistemology have a bi-directional connection in our tetrad of philosophical inquiry.

## Epistemology

Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge, especially regarding its methods, validity, and scope. It is the investigation of what distinguishes justified true belief (as a definition of knowledge) from opinion. The approach taken in this book is influenced by my Christian worldview and tends toward McGrath’s explication of Bhaskar’s ideas, an epistemology called critical realism. [1] You may be an empiricist, a rationalist, a pragmatist, maybe an idealist, or you may not think about your epistemology or worldview. But, whether you think about it or not theoretically, you are practicing some form of epistemology practically. If you believe all worldview are equally valid then you’re worldview is postmodern, sometimes also referred to as relative. The epistemology you follow impacts, potentially unconsciously, what you believe and in turn what you believe impacts your epistemology.  Since what you believe also influences how you behave and how you make decisions it is bound to influence your clinical reasoning. It is also possible that your epistemology may not cohere with other aspects of your worldview which can lead to inconsistencies and contradictions. Since the purpose of this book is on clinical inquiry we do not deal with personal inconsistencies or contradictions.  In this chapter we start with realism as a step toward a common ground for most people called common sense realism as a set of epistemological axioms that most people tend to agree.

### Realism

In philosophy realism is classically juxtaposed to nominalism. So our first step is to accept realism as an axiomatic foundation and we start by understanding nominalism. Nominalism is the view that things denominated by the same term share nothing except that fact.  What all chairs have in common is that they are called ‘chairs’ and that is all. Nominalism is associated with the thought that everything that exists is a particular (pleural, particulars), and therefore there are no universals, only a bunch of particulars.  A universal is a property or relation that can be instanced or instantiated by a number of particulars. You can think of this as related to set theory. If you can put all the particulars into into a set and comprehend something about the particulars based on the fact that they are part of the set then that set is a universal. Nominalism denies the existence of universals. It claims only particulars exist and denies the existence of sets of particulars that have meaning, provide context and contribute to knowledge. Realism accepts the existence of universals.[1] Also, it does not deny the existence of particulars. It simply allows categorizing particulars into universals (universal sets). If this all sounds strange to you it is most likely that you’ve simply been accepting realism your entire life. One extreme example is that if you don’t accept realism then just because (1 + 1 = 2) doesn’t mean that it will equal 2 the next time you encounter (1 + 1). All of the mathematical, logical and scientific laws we take for granted as giving us a framework for learning, generating knowledge and using knowledge are based on realism - the acceptance of universals. Therefore in a Clinical Inquiry we accept realism as an axiom.

Why is it important to identify realism as an axiom when most of you have been functioning this way for your entire lives? Realism implies the existence of universals and particulars. Because of the existence and occasional complexity of particulars we can occasionally slip into nominalism thinking. It is important that you learn to consider something as a particular and as a universal as a realist. It is important that you do not slip into nominalist thinking such as “all patients are unique” as the only truth. All patients are unique (particular), and all patients are the same as a universal (they are patients). The universal “patient” entails similar features among all things in that universal set. The American Physical Therapy Association Code of Ethics applies to the universal patient set, and thus to all particular patients. Patients are particular in their goals; but patients are universal in having goals. 
An example of slipping into nominalist thinking is thinking that none of the research applies to your patient because your patient is a particular and the research (as a particular) did not include your patient. Another example is saying that all pain is particular. If all pain is truly particular then there is no sense in having something called pain science, there is no sense in attempting to remediate the pain with an intervention attempted in another particular. So the ability to learn what works through observation (unstructured as experiences and structured as research) and apply it to another situation of pain entails the universal. 
From realism we can engage in the very useful activity of considering aspects that make something particular and those that make it universal. Pressure driven flow is a universal, we can consider the particulars of pressure driven flow in the bulk flow of the circulatory system; the bulk flow of pulmonary ventilation; and the diffusion flow of gas exchange. A synovial joint is a universal, we can consider the particulars of the elbow joint, the knee joint, the hip joint and the shoulder joint. Further, a ball and socket synovial joint is a universal that only includes the hip and shoulder joints from the above example. A final way to say this is that you’ve spent the better part of your life comparing and contrasting, considering what makes something particular and what is universal. Learning about the universals allows you to understand something about additional particulars. Learning how to relate particulars to universals is very much core to physical therapy practice. Every time you try to identify a problem in a particular case you are comparing the particular case to various universals. 

#### Set Enumeration & Set Comprehension

Set theory is utilized in logic and mathematics and can be utilized to drive home a point about particulars and universals. There are two approaches to indicate the elements of a set. Set enumeration lists all elements of the set. To enumerate means to specify one after another. If \[S\] is a set, then set enumeration leads to \[S = \left\{ {{x_1},{x_2},{x_3},...,{x_n}} \right\}\] for a set of \[n\] particular elements. Set comprehension is based on an understanding (comprehension) about the set as a universal to indicate the elements of a set. With set comprehension, \[S = \left\{ {\left. x \right|1 \le x \le n:x} \right\}\], which means \[S\] contains elements of \[x\] from 1 through \[n\]. As an example, using set enumeration: \[T = \left\{ {2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512} \right\}\]; and set comprehension: \[T = \left\{ {\left. x \right|1 \le x \le 8:{2^x}} \right\}\]
In this more concrete example we see the value of set comprehension. By comprehending the universal feature of set \[T\] as the number 2 raised to the power of integers 1 through 8 we comprehend (understand) something about that set and can therefore explain the set using an expression about this universal characteristic. Set comprehension can also be defined in terms of testing membership in a set. A member of set \[T\] is 2 raised to the power of an integer between 1 and 8.  To put this in context. Synovial joints all have a capsule and are filled with synovial fluid. We can enumerate the set of all synovial joints, or we can comprehend the set of all synovial joints. When you define synovial joint you are using set comprehension in terms of testing membership in that set. When you comprehend the set you understand something useful about the set and can, from that understanding, still enumerate. For example the set of synovial joints (has a capsule and is filled with synovial fluid) can be extended to, or simply connect the fact that every synovial joint has a closed and open pack position and a capsular pattern. Knowing that the set has these features allows you to make that statement without having to enumerate the fact for every synovial joint in particular. It also provides immediate conditions for which to test whether new particulars are elements of that set which is a valuable exercise regardless of the outcome.

- [1] C. S. Peirce saw realism as an argument against nominalism. While there are varieties of realism, a common core for all realists is the affirmation of  the real existence of some kind of thing or some kind of fact or affairs. Peirce (and others) saw that nominalism was damaging to epistemology.
