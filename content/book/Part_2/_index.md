## Introduction to Metaphysics

In development

Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that examines the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, between substance and attribute, and between potentiality and actuality.[1]

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics from "metaphysics". American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (5th ed.). 2011. Retrieved 24 November 2018.

The core idea is that examining the fundamental nature of reality for the practice of physical therapy requires an understanding of complex adaptive systems (CAS) including the relationship between what we can know and what exists of CAS (mind and matter), what they are and how they behave (substance and attribute), and between how they can behave and how they do behave (potentiality and actuality). There is tremendous benefit in considering CAS for PT practice in this way (fundamental nature) even while admiting that there are many many unique CAS to deal with in PT practice. If we can extract universal features of CAS relevant for PT then we gain understanding that unifies several particulars.

### Systems

Systems are sets of interacting or interdependent component parts forming a complex/intricate whole. While physical therapists work with the movement system at different hierarchical scales (cellular inflammation and whole body movement during functional tasks in various environments), they also work within broader systems (ethics / values systems, psychosocial systems and health systems). Therefore it seems worthwhile to have a broad perspective on systems and to understand the interactions between various system components. Additionally a conceptual focus on systems provides deeper insights into the human movement system - insights yet to be realized. And combined with an understanding of adaptation and causation (both below) we are better prepared to understand, study and apply empirical evidence to knowledge generation and knowledge application.


### Adaptation

Something we know about systems is that they can change with time. A system that demonstrates this trait is a dynamic system.  The human movement system is a dynamic system based on this simple consideration. Changes over time are often adaptations in response to internal or external disturbances. For example, in anatomy you have learned that structure impacts function right now; and that function impacts structure eventually. Function impacts structure eventually because structure adapts to function. A system with many interacting or interdependent component parts that adapt have been referred to as complex adaptive systems to put emphasis on the adaptive process.[1] Adaptation as a process does not necessarily involve a particular anatomic or physiologic function or interaction, but a process made possible by changes to system components and interactions. There is a hierarchy of adaptations that corresponds to the hierarchy of systems and the hierarchy of system components (genetic, epigenetic, biological, physiological, anatomical, behavioral, cultural / social). Broadly speaking, physical therapy practice includes promoting positive adaptive processes while minimizing negative adaptive processes. Therefore, as a concept, adaptation binds together what might otherwise be covered in separate courses (such as anatomical changes, healing, physiological adaptations such as to immobility and exercise, motor learning) so that students can better understand the underlying processes as well as the interactions and similarities. The logic of adaptation, also a concept yet to be fully explored, binds together clinical reasoning.

Something that makes physical therapy unique is the attempt to curtail adaptations across such a large hierarchy (biological through social). Emerging beyond the individual, the APTA's current Vision statement explicitly calls for a "transformation of society" which is essentially an adaptation of culture. An understanding of systems and system adaptation (dynamic systems, complex adaptive systems) should help prepare the profession for innovation and transformation. Understanding the logic of adaptation enables us to see not only how things are with better understanding of complex adaptive interactions, but see how things could be improved through adaptive processes.
