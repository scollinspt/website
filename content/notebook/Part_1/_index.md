# Introduction

## Causal Models

The ultimate goal of Part I is that the reader will recognize and utilize causal models as logico-mathematical representations of reality (including its uncertainty) with which we practice (reason and make decisions), and from which we develop further understanding through research. The state of knowledge in the profession at any point in time can be considered as equivalent to the set of all the possible causal models we can build and from which we practice; and when working with a patient we can consider the patient (at a moment in time) as an instantiation (a particular state) of one to several inter-connected causal models and that there is a complex underlying dynamic of change that is, at least partially, predicted from state to state by the causal model.

## Purpose

Clinical Inquiry is being proposed as a system for clinical logic, epistemology and reasoning (CLEaR). The purpose of such an undertaking started to answer the question: What can be done to improve the utilization of research by physical therapists in practice? [1,2] It has now expanded to include explicit consideration of what can be done to improve clinical reasoning through the utilization of knowledge in practice. We accept the definition of knowledge as justified true belief.  Goals include increasing the effectiveness of inquiry to: generate knowledge through the rigorous rational (mental, mindful, reflective) interpretation of observations (structured as research, and experienced in practice); and utilize knowledge in both practice and continued research. It is proposed that even by making progress toward these goals we can better educate students in preparation for entry level and subsequently expert practice, reduce cognitive biases and errors in reasoning, and reduce variability in practice decisions in a way that clinical practice guidelines have not been able to achieve.


Clinical Inquiry as a system includes clinical reasoning so it is helpful to define clinical reasoning. A complete understanding of this definition requires an understanding of inference (Chapter 3) so the reader is asked to keep this in mind while progressing through Chapters 1 and 2. Clinical reasoning includes making inferences iteratively across time (dynamic inference); and making decisions based on those inferences. Therefore, clinical reasoning is dynamic inference and decision making.  Clinical reasoning as a stream of dynamic inferences that enable clinical decision making are then combined with carrying out the decisions and in sum is called clinical practice. Therefore, clinical practice is combining decisions with carrying out those decisions.

## First Principles Approach

Clinical Inquiry is developed from first principles. First principles are basic propositions taken as assumptions that are not deduced from other propositions [1]. Attempting to understand Clinical Inquiry as a system of thought from first principles requires consideration of the foundations of your thinking.

Where do we begin? Clinical Inquiry has the same issue of where to begin that plagues any philosophical inquiry. In the process we encounter what we’ll consider the philosophical tetrad (from the Greek, tetras, a set of four) including logic, metaphysics, epistemology and value theory. As a tetrad of philosophical inquiry they are all important. When starting with one component of the tetrad it is a choice not a requirement and the choice requires assumptions of the other members of the tetrad. If we start with logic (rules for thinking) we have to accept our axioms based on some engagement with metaphysics (how things are) and epistemology (how we know things). If we start with metaphysics we must consider logic, epistemology and value theory. In other words, regardless of where we start in the tetrad we are held accountable by the others. This tetrad is a modification of the tri-perspectival approach introduced by Frame [2] with an incorporation of logic, based on the work of Poythress (a student and collaborator of Frame)[3].

Therefore, while this book focuses on the logic and epistemology of clinical reasoning it does so with underlying and unavoidable assumptions about metaphysics and value theory. Those assumptions are explained as necessary throughout the text.

## Logical & Epistemological Axioms

Logic and epistemology offer tools that have a long history and have been demonstrated to be reasonably effective to address the questions and goals of our clinical inquiry. These areas of philosophy provide axioms (first principles) for rules to guide thought and address what and how something can be considered knowledge (known). The axioms included in our system come from Bhaskar’s critical realism [1] and Gries & Schneider’s equational logic [2]. From these axioms we develop an understanding of validity, inference, theorems, probability and causation. A clinical inquiry must be coherent, integrated and consistent. The communication of this clinical inquiry must also balance too much detail regarding how these theoretical foundations emerge to their practical implications and the need to be practical. Future revisions will expand upon connections currently accepted in an attempt to fulfill the requirement of being coherent, integrated and consistent.

## Necessity of Logic & Epistemology

Logic and epistemology are both necessary for clinical reasoning and therefore for clinical practice. Logic includes the rules of thinking that allows deduction and forms of valid inferences. This is a necessary component of deductive reasoning utilized to identify the most appropriate plan of care in a particular situation on the basis of a set of assumed premises (interventional reasoning). Epistemology includes probability as an approach to belief and knowledge. This is a necessary component of the inductive reasoning utilized to generate universally accepted truths (universals developed through observations) that can be utilized in deductive arguments. Both epistemology and logic are required for appropriate consideration of abductive reasoning utilized to identify the most likely set of situations (causes, risks, modifiers) that resulted in a current situation (diagnostic reasoning). Abductive reasoning looks suspiciously like deduction without the ability to be valid and therefore requires epistemology and probability to achieve a level of justification to be considered believable. 

Despite the necessity of this dynamic interplay of inferential approaches in clinical reasoning it is rare to consider probability and statistics within the broader framework of epistemology; and it is rare to consider epistemology along with logic in the literature on clinical reasoning. Yet they are all necessary for any consideration of our reasoning and decision making. Any system of reasoning and decision making begins with and builds from a logical and epistemological foundation. If you have not considered the logical and epistemological foundation for your clinical reasoning then you are more likely to succumb to fallacies, errors and biases in your clinical reasoning.

## Causation, Adaptation & Systems

We keep three important and emerging concepts for physical therapy practice in mind to provide context for examples while learning about the foundational axioms and definitions  They are causation, adaptation and systems. The foundations for clinical reasoning apply to any profession engaged in such reasoning. These three concepts are important to physical therapy (indeed to rehabilitation). Other concepts would likely emerge if applying this clinical inquiry approach to other professions. Since the author’s background and primary purpose through the years has been understanding physical therapy clinical reasoning these are the concepts that emerged from his inquiry. As concepts he has found them useful to focus the objective for reasoning and hence they could be considered metaphysical foundations. Returning to the tetrad, we realize that we must consider metaphysics whenever considering logic and epistemology.

### Systems

Systems are sets of interacting or interdependent component parts forming a complex/intricate whole.[1] While physical therapists work with the movement system at different hierarchical scales (cellular inflammation and whole body movement during functional tasks in various environments), they also work within broader systems (ethics / values systems, psychosocial systems and health systems). Therefore it seems worthwhile to have a broad perspective on systems and to understand the interactions between various system components. Additionally a conceptual focus on systems provides deeper insights into the human movement system - insights yet to be realized. And combined with an understanding of adaptation and causation (both below) we are better prepared to understand, study and apply empirical evidence to knowledge generation and knowledge application.

### Adaptation

Something we know about systems is that they can change with time. A system that demonstrates this trait is a dynamic system.  The human movement system is a dynamic system based on this simple consideration. Changes over time are often adaptations in response to internal or external disturbances. For example, in anatomy you have learned that structure impacts function right now; and that function impacts structure eventually. Function impacts structure eventually because structure adapts to function. A system with many interacting or interdependent component parts that adapt have been referred to as complex adaptive systems to put emphasis on the adaptive process.[1] Adaptation as a process does not necessarily involve a particular anatomic or physiologic function or interaction, but a process made possible by changes to system components and interactions. There is a hierarchy of adaptations that corresponds to the hierarchy of systems and the hierarchy of system components (genetic, epigenetic, biological, physiological, anatomical, behavioral, cultural / social). Broadly speaking, physical therapy practice includes promoting positive adaptive processes while minimizing negative adaptive processes. Therefore, as a concept, adaptation binds together what might otherwise be covered in separate courses (such as anatomical changes, healing, physiological adaptations such as to immobility and exercise, motor learning) so that students can better understand the underlying processes as well as the interactions and similarities. The logic of adaptation, also a concept yet to be fully explored, binds together clinical reasoning.

Something that makes physical therapy unique is the attempt to curtail adaptations across such a large hierarchy (biological through social). Emerging beyond the individual, the APTA's current Vision statement explicitly calls for a "transformation of society" which is essentially an adaptation of culture. An understanding of systems and system adaptation (dynamic systems, complex adaptive systems) should help prepare the profession for innovation and transformation. Understanding the logic of adaptation enables us to see not only how things are with better understanding of complex adaptive interactions, but see how things could be improved through adaptive processes.

### Causation

Causation is necessary to understand the logic of adaptation. It is also more fundamental and closer to the philosophical home of our axioms and foundations. Any attempt to understand, predict future states or manipulate a system and/or its adaptation requires an understand causation. Cause - effect relationships are the foundational concept of all clinical and scientific inquiry (including practice). The only reason to believe a treatment will work is that the belief that there is a cascade of mechanisms (cause - effect responses) triggered by the treatment and the sum of the effect is adaptation. The only reason to believe in the process of diagnosis based on signs and symptoms is to believe certain conditions cause a certain rather unique pattern of signs and symptoms.

Understanding causation can seem rather simple. What is complicated is understanding causation in a real world complex system where there are many components and a vast hierarchy of emerging and interacting parts. There is a stark contrast between closed and open systems, particularly when it comes to the study of causation within these systems. This contrast underlies the classic problem of generalization - how to take an understanding about causal relationships from a closed system (experimental conditions) to the patient in an open system (real life). Therefore while the inclusion of causation as a concept is entailed by the axioms (forthcoming). The actual identification of cause - effect relationships in the real world and under what conditions and in what contexts they apply is an important application of the clinical inquiry process. There is a focus on attempting to understand the ways of knowing causal relationships in light of underlying complex interaction. This is why clinical inquiry includes the consideration of graphical causal model representations of causal networks (as logical structures) that then allow the development of reasoning patterns based on the network structure. This is an overarching approach for both how knowledge is developed from evidence (evidence based practice), and how we should practice based on the knowledge (knowledge based practice).
