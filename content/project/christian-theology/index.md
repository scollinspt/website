This project, as any Christian life, is persistently under development.

A devotional life project about the ultimately critical questions we all must face. This project is very personal. However, considering the American Physical Therapy Association's Vision Statement for the profession (Transforming society by optimizing movement to improve the human experience), we recognize clear foundational beliefs, values and ethics surrounding the idea of transforming society (in what image), what it means to optimize movement, and what is the the human experience that we are attempting to improve? Can this Vision be realized with a secular materialistic worldview with its propensity when it extends to its logical conclusion to result in nihilism? 

A quick story so I don't forget to include this when further developing the site for this project. A few years ago there was a course being offered at PSU that was to consider what the world (or country, I honestly forget) would be like if everyone lived according to a Taoist faith. It explicitely mentioned "as opposed to a Christian faith". Having the opportunity to speak to the professor offering the course, I asked, is the "as opposed to a Christian faith" going to consider whether the current number of US citizens associating with the Christian faith as living consistently with that faith? Or are you going to just take the current state of affairs in the US (or the world) and attribute it to the Christian faith? This raises a question of scaling from personal behavior to social, political and economic behavior. This is not a question that I can take up in a quickly put together placeholder paragraph - rather - it is a question that would require an entire scholarly project and significant time to outline, research and contemplate. While it would be about scaling from personal behavior to societal behavior, for the person doing the project it would entail significant study of Christian theology, apologetics and spiritual discipline (not to mention biology, psychology, sociology and economics).
