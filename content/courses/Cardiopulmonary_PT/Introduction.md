In this introductory tutorial we consider what we are attempting to accomplish, as a physical therapist, when encountering a patient with a *signs of a cardiopulmonary condition*, or for a patient for which *physical endurance limits participation or activity*.

## Preliminary considerations

First let's consider the following variables:
* signs of a cardiopulmonary condition 
* physical endurance limits participation or activity
* reversibility (adaptability)

#### Signs of a cardiopulmonary condition 

Whether there are *signs of a cardiopulmonary condition* is important, and whether the underlying condition is already known, known and primary (the reason for the current episode of care, the "history of present illness") or known and secondary (past medical history) influences the probability of whether the condition is causing the signs. But for our consideration right now it does not matter as in all circumstances the prior probability of a cardiopulmonary condition having a causal influence on the patient's presentation is increased if we know, from the outset, that they have signs of a cardiopulmonary condition. If a condition is not known to be present up front then there is a lower prior probability, but we must consider that prior probability in light of presenting signs and symptoms, as well as other risk factors or etiologies in the examination and evaluation. But for now, we can consider *cardiopulmonary condition* as a binary (Boolean) variable with true (yes) or false (no) as options.

#### Physical endurance limits participation or activity

The emphasis on physical endurance is simply to distinguish from attention, cognitive functions or any other activity for which a person may find themselves needing to sustain. As physical therapists these are important for our practice, but they are not the primary focus of our "physical" therapy. Physical endurance is a continuous variable that varies within a person, in large part, based on the activity the person is participating. Thus, *physical endurance limits participation or activity* becomes a binary (Boolean) variable with true (yes) or false (no) as options, and can be further broken down by activity that the person is participating in. For example, as a question: *Does physical endurance limit participation or activity?* We must consider what the activity or participation is, and we end up with several questions, each with potentially different answers. *Does physical endurance limit walking around the house?* *Does physical endurance limit ascending the stairs in your home?*


#### Reversibility

Reversibility is another example of a continuous variable that to ease our cognitive burden we consider binary (yes/no). When considering reversibility you are making a judgement on the cause of a problem and then on the characteristics and mechanisms of that cause. For example, if the CP sign is shortness of breath and you've inferred that a contributing cause is respiratory muscle weakness, you are faced with determining the reversibility of the patient's respiratory muscle weakness.

### Quadrant state space based on these generalized variables

Starting with only people in which *Physical endurance limits participation or activity* we can then consider *signs of a cardiopulmonary condition* and *reversibility* to help guide our approach. With these two variables cast as questions each with two possible answers (yes/no) we can consider 4 possible situations.

|                | + CP signs  |- CP signs      |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  + R | A   | B    |
|  - R | C  | D    |


## But first

Much of our early consideration for examination and evaluation in patients with primary or secondary cardiopulmonary conditions is centered on considering where, at a point in time, someone falls within this quadrant space. But before going to far we will consider medical stability as the very first consideration for proceeding.
