In this introductory tutorial we consider what we are attempting to accomplish, as a physical therapist, when encountering a patient with a *primary or secondary cardiopulmonary condition*, or for a patient for which *physical endurance limits participation or activity*.

## Preliminary considerations

First let's consider the following variables:
* cardiopulmonary condition (primary or secondary)
* physical endurance limits participation or activity

### Cardiopulmonary condition (primary or secondary)

Whether a cardiopulmonary condition is known to be present up front is important, and whether it is primary (the reason for the current episode of care, the "history of present illness") vs secondary (past medical history) influences (sometimes to the behest of) a clinician's reasoning. But for our consideration right now it does not matter as in both circumstances the prior probability of a cardiopulmonary condition having a causal influence on the patient's presentation is increased if we know, from the outset, that they have or have had a cardiopulmonary condition. If a condition is not known to be present up front then there is a lower prior probability, but we must consider that prior probability in light of presenting signs and symptoms, as well as other risk factors or etiologies in the examination and evaluation. But for now, we can consider *cardiopulmonary condition* as a binary (Boolean) variable with true (yes) or false (no) as options.

### Physical endurance limits participation or activity

The emphasis on physical endurance is simply to distinguish from attention, cognitive functions or any other activity for which a person may find themselves needing to sustain. As physical therapists these are important for our practice, but they are not the primary focus of our "physical" therapy. Physical endurance is a continuous variable that varies within a person, in large part, based on the activity the person is participating. Thus, *physical endurance limits participation or activity* becomes a binary (Boolean) variable with true (yes) or false (no) as options, and can be further broken down by activity that the person is participating in. For example, as a question: *Does physical endurance limit participation or activity?* We must consider what the activity or participation is, and we end up with several questions, each with potentially different answers. *Does physical endurance limit walking around the house?* *Does physical endurance limit ascending the stairs in your home?*
