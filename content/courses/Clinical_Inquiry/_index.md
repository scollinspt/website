## Goals

The goal of developing a CLEaR *Clinical Inquiry* includes increasing the effectiveness to: *generate* knowledge through the rigorous rational (mental, mindful, reflective) interpretation of observations (structured as research, and experienced in practice); and *utilize* knowledge in both practice and continued research. Making progress toward these goals we can better educate physical therapists for entry level and subsequently expert practice, reduce cognitive biases and errors in reasoning, and reduce variability in practice decisions in a way that clinical practice guidelines have not been able to achieve.

## Three course sequence

In the DPT program at Plymouth State University the CLEaR system is taught with a three course sequence:

* Clinical Inquiry I
* Clinical Inquiry II
* Clinical Inquiry III
