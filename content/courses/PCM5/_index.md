## Course goal

At the end of this course the student can effectively examine, evaluate and develop an appropriate course of action (response), intervention, referral or physical therapy plan of care for a person with primary or secondary cardiovascular or pulmonary conditions, or for a patient for which physical endurance limits participation or activity. All of the above is expected in light of all other areas of professional physical therapy practice and is expected with appropriate awareness of and deference to currently accepted best practice.

## Context

What has traditionally been called a *Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy* course is the first module of the `PCM5` course in the Plymouth State University DPT program.  Technically it is dependent on all prior courses in that PSU-DPT curriculum (soft dependency), it has a hard dependency on several prerequisite courses. Hard dependency courses include:

* Clinical Physiology
* Clinical Inquiry 1 (clinical reasoning, causation, Bayesian inference)
* PCM 1 - 4 (PCM process of examination, evaluation, intervention)
* Pathophysiology & Pharmacology 1 & 2 
* Dynamic Systems 1 and 2 (adaptation)

## Background

There are two somewhat unique features of this course in a DPT curriculum. These have become more apparent to me during my long tenure of teaching (have been teaching it annually since January 1996 in three different DPT programs with some overlap - so for 2 years I taught it twice a year - making Spring 2021 my 28th time teaching it). Well, the first was taught to me in my first lecture for my cardiopulmonary PT class as a student at UMass Lowell in Spring 1993 by Dr. Joseph Dorsey. To paraphrase, Dr. Dorsey let us know that this course is the one that prepares us to work on what he called serious situations. What he meant was that cardiopulmonary physical therapy is an area of practice where the physical therapist may be expected to intervene in a way that supports life in a more direct manner than in other areas of practice. Now, all physical therapy supports life. But the need for a breath of air, enabled and enhanced by cardiopulmonary physical therapy interventions, is life enabling in a more immediate way than many other areas of practice. To consider this, consider the time frame for which you can go without food, water or air. Clearly, air is something you need in a more immediate way. Admittedly this is not a common area of PT practice, but it is an area students must be aware of nonetheless. Second, if partitioning a DPT program patient care concepts by impairments and limitations, cardiopulmonary physical therapy tends to be the area students learn about physical endurance; and in terms of patient symptoms, the focus tends to be on shortness of breath (not exclusively). So while in a course on neuromuscular and musculoskeletal PT the primary impairments may be balance, stability (in a mechanical sense), movement (being able to do, not necessarily to sustain, a task); in a cardiopulmonary PT course the primary impairment is an inability to sustain (physical endurance) a task. Of course we are all fully practicing PTs, and most patients have a combination of issues which means patients will often require clinicians that can fully comprehend all of these areas as an integrated whole (another goal of this course when taken in total).
