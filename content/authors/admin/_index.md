Professor of Physical Therapy with a teaching emphasis on clinical inquiry and reasoning. Founded and directed the Plymouth State University DPT program but relinquished administrative duties in 2020 in order to focus on scholarship (teaching and research). Scholarly interests merge a conceptual foundation of practice (stress and adaptation) with clinical reasoning (particularly logic, epistemology and causation).
