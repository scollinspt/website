Professor of Physical Therapy with a teaching emphasis on clinical inquiry and reasoning. Founded and directed the Plymouth State University DPT program but relinquished administrative duties in 2020 in order to focus on teaching and scholarship. Research interests are in stress physiology, particularly elucidating Selye's concept of *adaptation energy* based on an understanding of biological information, physiological stratification and Karasek's conception of ordering capacity.
